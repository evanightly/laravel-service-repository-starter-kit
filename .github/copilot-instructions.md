# [Project Name]

This is a Laravel 12 and ReactJS project with a focus on modularity, maintainability, and scalability. The project is designed to handle complex business logic through a repository-service pattern and an intent-based system for routing requests.
The goal is to create a clean and efficient codebase that adheres to best practices in both Laravel and ReactJS development.
The project is built with a focus on TypeScript for the frontend, ensuring type safety and maintainability. The backend is built with Laravel 12, utilizing the latest features and best practices in PHP development.

## Stack

-   Laravel
-   Inertia: Laravel and ReactJS adapter
-   ReactJS
-   MariaDB

Note: this is a typescript project, safe typing is my priority for this project scalability, and windows is my main operating system, but this project will run in docker environment

## Crucial Dependencies

### Backend

-   https://github.com/adobrovolsky97/laravel-repository-service-pattern : to handle service and repository process, decouple the application's business logic from the specific implementation details of data storage

### Frontend

-   @tanstack/react-query : to handle data transaction process (look at the implementation of the serviceHooksFactory.ts)
-   NyxbUI : ReactJS component library, similar with ShadCN but with enhancement of animation and offers unique components

## Project Flow and Architecture

### Overall Data Flow

1. **Frontend Request Initiation**:

    - React components call methods from appropriate service hooks (e.g., `postServiceHook.useCreate()`)
    - Service hooks are created using the `serviceHooksFactory` pattern which standardizes CRUD operations
    - Custom operations use the intent parameter system to trigger specialized logic

2. **Frontend to Backend Communication**:

    - TanStack Query manages API requests, caching, and state invalidation
    - Requests flow through Inertia.js to Laravel backend
    - The `intent` query parameter determines which business logic to execute

3. **Backend Processing**:
    - Controllers receive requests and delegate to appropriate service based on intent
    - Services contain business logic and call repositories for data operations
    - Repositories handle direct data manipulation using Eloquent models
    - Results are transformed through Laravel Resources and returned to frontend

### Frontend Service Hook Pattern

The service hook pattern is built around the `serviceHooksFactory.ts` which:

```typescript
// Standard pattern for all service hooks
export const someModelServiceHook = {
    ...serviceHooksFactory<SomeModelResource>({
        baseRoute: ROUTES.SOME_MODELS,
        baseKey: TANSTACK_QUERY_KEYS.SOME_MODELS,
    }),
    // Custom methods for specific business logic
    useCustomOperation: () => {
        return createMutation({
            mutationFn: async (params) => {
                return mutationApi({
                    method: 'post',
                    url: route(`${ROUTES.SOME_MODELS}.store`),
                    data: params,
                    params: { intent: IntentEnum.SOME_MODEL_CUSTOM_OPERATION },
                });
            },
            invalidateQueryKeys: [{ queryKey: [TANSTACK_QUERY_KEYS.SOME_MODELS], exact: false }],
        });
    },
};
```

### Intent System

The intent system routes specific business logic through generic CRUD endpoints:

1. **Frontend**: Intent is specified in the request parameters:

    ```typescript
    params: {
        intent: IntentEnum.SOME_MODEL_CUSTOM_OPERATION;
    }
    ```

2. **Backend Controller**: Controller checks for intent and routes accordingly:

    ```php
    // Typical controller method with intent routing
    public function store(StoreSomeModelRequest $request)
    {
        $intent = $request->get('intent', IntentEnum::DEFAULT_STORE);

        switch($intent) {
            case IntentEnum::SOME_MODEL_CUSTOM_OPERATION:
                return $this->someModelService->customOperation($request->validated());
            default:
                return $this->someModelService->store($request->validated());
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Form Request Validation**: Each intent may have specific validation rules:
    ```php
    // Form request with intent-specific validation
    public function rules(): array
    {
        $rules = [
            'name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
            'description' => ['nullable', 'string']
        ];

        $intent = $this->get('intent', IntentEnum::DEFAULT_STORE);

        if ($intent === IntentEnum::SOME_MODEL_CUSTOM_OPERATION) {
            $rules['additional_field'] = ['required', 'array'];
        }

        return $rules;
    }
    ```

### Repository-Service Pattern

1. **Services**: Contain business logic, call repositories, handle events:

    ```php
    // Service implementation
    class SomeModelService implements SomeModelServiceInterface
    {
        public function __construct(
            protected SomeModelRepositoryInterface $someModelRepository
        ) {}

        public function customOperation(array $data)
        {
            // Business logic implementation
            $result = $this->someModelRepository->customQuery($data);
            event(new CustomOperationEvent($result));
            return $result;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Repositories**: Handle data operations using Eloquent:
    ```php
    // Repository implementation
    class SomeModelRepository extends BaseRepository implements SomeModelRepositoryInterface
    {
        public function __construct(SomeModel $model)
        {
            parent::__construct($model);
        }

        public function customQuery(array $data)
        {
            // Data manipulation logic
            return $this->model->where('field', $data['field'])->get();
        }
    }
    ```

### TanStack Query Management

1. **Query Keys**: Centralized in `tanstackQueryKeys.ts`:

    ```typescript
    export const TANSTACK_QUERY_KEYS = {
        SOME_MODELS: 'some_models',
        GLOBAL_SOME_MODELS: 'global_some_models',
    };
    ```

2. **Query Invalidation**: After mutations, relevant queries are invalidated:

    ```typescript
    invalidateQueryKeys: [{ queryKey: [TANSTACK_QUERY_KEYS.SOME_MODELS], exact: false }];
    ```

3. **Query Generation**: Helper functions generate consistent query keys:
    ```typescript
    queryKey: generateUseGetAllQueryKey(baseKey, filters);
    ```

### Full Request Lifecycle Example

1. User clicks "Sync Posts" button in UI
2. React component calls `postServiceHook.useSyncPosts().mutate()`
3. `serviceHooksFactory` creates a mutation with `IntentEnum.POST_SYNC_POSTS` intent
4. Request is sent to `/posts` endpoint with intent parameter
5. `PostController@index` receives request, detects intent, calls `PostService@syncPosts`
6. `PostService` contains business logic, delegates to `PostRepository` for data operations
7. `PostService` dispatches `SyncPostsJob` for background processing
8. Job execution progress is broadcast via WebSockets using `SyncProgressEvent`
9. Frontend updates UI based on WebSocket events and refetches data when complete

## Rules

-   Be opinionated
-   Use latest and stable approach
-   Creativity to make better code is welcome but avoid too much hallucination, stay at the current context
-   If i ask you about the errors, please explain logically why is that happen so I will understand deeper about the current issue
-   If you want to create custom business process logic other than basic CRUD, use the IntentEnum.php to store custom key that trigger those custom logic in controller, then add condition for those intent in the form request for specific case (either StoreRequest or UpdateRequest depending on the business process logic), so no more new controllers, route, etc, dont worry about IntentEnum.ts, because the vite will always regenerate its content if the IntentEnum.php updated
-   Make the code clean, modular, and generalized, but not too coupled
-   Don't delete anything related to developer comments or notes about // TODO: , // BUG: , etc
-   Any breaking change ideas must be asked first before integrating the code directly on the codebase
-   If i ask to add something, do only adding, DON'T remove other code, focus on the current context to maintain safe code
-   Im up for discussion, if there's anything to ask, ask away, it's better to ask first rather than changing the code with reckless behavior
-   CRUCIAL!: if editing existing code, do not replace the code with the comments like `ts // ...existing code...` it will make the code break and leave thousand of errors
